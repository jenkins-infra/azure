= Azure tooling setup

This document is meant to outline how you can set up your local environment for
hacking on the Azure tooling for the Jenkins project infrastructure.


All examples below for setting up Azure resources are done with the
link:https://github.com/azure/azure-cli[azure-cli].


== Setting up Terraform

link:http://terraform.io[Terraform]
can be used via the
link:https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html[AzureRM provider]
which comes built in with recent versions of Terraform.

In order to authenticate against Azure, you must create some Azure Active
Directory and other related authentication and authorization objects.


*Generate an authentication token*

[source]
----
openssl rand -base64 24
----

This will be needed later, so don't lose it!


*Creating an OAuth Application*

[source]
----
az ad app create --display-name jenkins-terraform \
                    --homepage http://example.com/jenkins-terraform \
                    --identifier-uris http://example.com/jenkins-terraform \
                    --password $GENERATED_TOKEN
----


We can then retrieve the Application's ID via:

[source]
----
az ad app list -o tsv --query "[?displayName=='jenkins-terraform'].appId"`
----


Since permissions cannot be directly granted to an application, we must create a
Service Principle associated with the application and grant permissions to that.

*Creating a Service Principle*

[source]
----
az ad sp create --id $(az ad app list -o tsv --query "[?displayName=='jenkins-terraform'].appId"`)
----


Once a Service Principle exists, we can grant the permissions on it:


[source]
----
az role assignment create --assignee http://example.com/jenkins-terraform \
                            --role Owner \
                            --scope /subscriptions/be53081d-a3a2-499c-b355-8f5c3d4126e5
----



=== Creating the variables file


Create `.azure-terraform.json` in the root directory of this repository
containing:

[source, json]
----
{
    "prefix"          : "yourusername",
    "subscription_id" : "",
    "client_id"       : "",
    "client_secret"   : "",
    "location"        : "",
    "ssh_pubkey_path" : "",
    "tenant_id"       : ""
}
----

Where (assuming your subscription is named "Pay-As-You-Go"):

* `prefix` is your username, or some unique token to avoid namespace collisions in Azure
* `subscription_id` is the output of: `az account list -o tsv --query "[?name=='Pay-As-You-Go'].id"`
* `client_id` is the output of: `az ad app list -o tsv --query "[?displayName=='jenkins-terraform'].appId"`
* `client_secret` is the `$GENERATED_TOKEN` you created with `openssl` previously
* `location`: is the region where all resources are deployed by default as used links:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/azure/blob/709fce6c0f45af844732bd4995aa29b704131622/plans/ldap.tf#L6[here] for example.
* `ssh_pubkey_path`: is the ssh public key file used to configure admin user on linux virtual machines.
* `tenant_id` is the output of: `az account list -o tsv --query "[?name=='Pay-As-You-Go'].tenantId"`
