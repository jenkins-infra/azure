This repository is meant to hold documentation, tooling and other resources
related to the link:https://jenkins.io[Jenkins] project's migration to
link:https://azure.com[Azure].

= Requirements

In order to use this repository to provision the Jenkins infrastructure on azure, you need:

* An `Azure` account
* `Docker` to run terraform defined in this repository
* `Make` which simplify the different steps

= HowTo

== Provision

IMPORTANT: Don't blindly execute the terraform code located in this repository on your own account as it may lead your account bill to significantly increase.

Once you fulfill the requirements, you can use the code located here to provision this infrastructure on your azure account

. Add your public ssh key under `ssh_key` folder, but do not commit it as it only must be used for your personal environment.
. Create your `.azure-terraform.json` as exampled in the file HACKING.adoc
. Run `make init`: to create the remote azure storage that will host your terraform state.
. Run `make test_fmt validate`: to run linting checks and validate your resources.
. Run `make deploy`: to provision all resources on your account.


== Test

In order to test any modification on this repository, you need to

* Run linting tests on your machine `make test_fmt`, which don't need a azure account
* You may also run make validate, if you have an azure account configured but keep in minds that it implies deploying at least an azure storage to store a remote terraform state
* Open a pull request on link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/azure[jenkins-infra/azure], this will provision a temporary environment with your specific changes and then report provisionning logs on link:https://ci.jenkins.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/Infra%2Fazure/pr[ci.jenkins.io].
