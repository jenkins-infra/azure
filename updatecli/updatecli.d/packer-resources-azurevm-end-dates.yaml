      title: 'Extend Azure AD Application password validity for packer-resources (current end date: {{ source "currentEndDate" }})'
      description: |
        This PR generates a new Azure AD application password with a new end date for the packer-resources application (to allow building VM images).
        Once this PR is merged and deployed with success by Terraform (on infra.ci.jenkins.io),
        you can retrieve the new password value from the Terraform state with `terraform show -json`
        then searching for the new password in `values.value` of the `resource.azuread_application_password.packer` section (do NOT save it anywhere!)
        and (manually) update the packer credential as needed.
        Finally, verify that the new credential works by running a test Packer build.
