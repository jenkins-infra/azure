      You'll have to update **manually** the top-level credential `azure-jenkins-sponsorship-credentials` on the Jenkins UI.

      The new password value, once the PR is merged and deployed, can be retrieved from the Terraform state,
      by searching for `module.ci_jenkins_io_sponsorship.azuread_application_password.controller.value`.

      Finally, verify both Azure Credential and Azure VM clouds by checking that a click on the "Verify <...>" buttons returns a success,
      then restart the controller to ensure that the old credential is not kept in cache.

      You'll have to update the credential on infra.ci.jenkins.io's encrypted secrets:

      - Update the secret value in jenkins-infra/chart-secrets (or kubernetes-management/secrets), add, commit and push the change
      - Trigger a build of the `kubernetes-management` job on infra.ci.jenkins.io to ensure secret value is updated in Kubernetes secrets
      - Finally, trigger a controller restart (pod delete, or rollout) to make sure secrets are used to update the Jenkins credential.

      The new password value, once the PR is merged and deployed, can be retrieved from the Terraform state,
      by searching for `azuread_application_password.infra_ci_jenkins_io.value`.
